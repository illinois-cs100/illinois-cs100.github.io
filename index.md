### Course description
This course will cover a variety of fun and interesting topics related to getting settled in our CS department and making the best use of your time here. This will include:

+ Resources and organizations in the CS department
+ Navigating academic requirements
+ Academic integrity
+ CS research areas and research opportunities
+ Study abroad and in Chicago
+ Finding internships and jobs after graduation
  
This course is intended to be informative but not stressful. Grading will be based on attending lecture and doing online quizzes (roughly each week). I'm planning to record lectures and/or post detailed notes, and there will be some drops. So plan to attend lecture most weeks, but you won't have to come every week.

If you have a disability (DRES) accommodation letter that seems likely to affect your participation in this course, please email it to me so we can make a suitable plan.

### Class meetings and office hours
This class meets 3-3:50 on Fridays in Lincoln Hall Theater. For full credit, you must attend at least 10 lectures in person. Recordings of lectures and any associated notes will be posted on the schedule page

### Communication
We will use CampusWire as a course forum and message board...if you have questions post them there.
